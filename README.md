# Vista AI News Magazine Project Bootstrap Instructions

This repository currently contains no application code. It is reserved for receiving the
full implementation that will be generated by Codex/GPT according to the comprehensive
product specification provided in the "Vista AI News Magazine" document.

To proceed:

1. Provision an empty GitHub repository with write access for Codex/GPT.
2. Supply the "self-hosted superprompt" (section 20.3 of the specification) to Codex/GPT so it can scaffold the complete project, including Docker deployment assets.
3. After generation, clone the produced repository here, configure environment variables, and follow the deployment steps outlined in sections 20.6–20.11 of the document.

This README exists only as a reminder of the workflow required before any code is added.
